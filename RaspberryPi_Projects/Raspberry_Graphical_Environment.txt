Recommended Setup (Lightweight GUI + Touchscreen + Python GUI)

You need three things:

X server (to display windows)

A light window manager (Openbox or Fluxbox)

Touchscreen drivers + calibration

Python GUI toolkit (Tkinter or PyQt, etc.)

This keeps memory usage under ~80 MB, perfect for the Pi 1.

🟦 Step 1 — Install X11 + lightweight window manager

Openbox is the fastest option and works great with touchscreens.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends xserver-xorg xinit openbox


Start it manually:

startx


This gives you a minimal graphical desktop.

🟩 Step 2 — Install touchscreen support

If you’re using an official Raspberry Pi touchscreen or many common USB touchscreens:

sudo apt install xinput libinput-bin evtest


If it’s the official 7" DSI touchscreen → it works automatically.
For USB touchscreens, calibration may be needed.

Calibration tool:
sudo apt install xinput-calibrator

🟧 Step 3 — Install Python GUI support

For lightweight projects, Tkinter is best:

sudo apt install python3-tk


Then you can run turtle or your own GUIs.

If you want a stronger toolkit (but slower on Pi 1):

PyQt5:

sudo apt install python3-pyqt5


or PyGame:

sudo apt install python3-pygame

🟨 Step 4 — Auto-start your Python GUI on boot (optional)

If you want your touchscreen UI to start automatically:

Create a file:
mkdir -p ~/.config/openbox
nano ~/.config/openbox/autostart


Add:

python3 /home/pi/your_program.py &


Now startx will launch your GUI instantly.

To boot directly into GUI:

sudo raspi-config


→ System Options → Boot / Auto Login → Desktop Autologin
(Works even if you only installed X + Openbox)

🟥 Why NOT use raspberrypi-ui-mods?

Because on Pi 1, it is:

Slow

Heavy on RAM

Full of unnecessary Pi apps/tools

Not needed for touchscreen

Not needed for Python GUIs

Your Pi will run MUCH faster without it.

🟩 Summary

You will have:

✔ Lightweight graphical environment (X11 + Openbox)

✔ Touchscreen support

✔ Python GUI toolkit

✔ Fast performance, even on Pi 1

✔ Ability to run Python apps by touch

✔ No heavy desktop slowing things down
